Steps to setup project:

Create a database named as packt_demo.
clone the project from git on your local system.
rename .env.example file to .env (Note: default laravel .env.example file is renamed as .X_env.example)
open terminal and go to the project location root directory.
You need to run the command php artisan migrate to create tables.
Now the project setup part is done. To run the project, execute command php artisan serve.
Click on the project URL which is returned in the terminal and it will redirect you to the books page, where you can add, edit, delete, search books.
To create fake records you can click on the + fake books button. It will create 50 fake books. Repeat this step to create more fake records.
Note: In the project backend validation part is not done due to time shortage as I'm serving notice period and I have to give my 100% to my current company too.
