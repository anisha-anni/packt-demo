Steps to setup project:

Create a database named as packt_demo.
Clone the project from git on your local system (https://github.com/anisha-anni/packt-demo.git).
Open terminal and go to the project location root directory.
Run commands given below:
composer update
php artisan migrate

Now the project setup part is done. To run the project, execute below command-
php artisan serve

Click on the project URL which is returned in the terminal and it will redirect you to the books page, where you can add, edit, delete, search books.
To create fake records you can click on the + fake books button. It will create 50 fake books. Repeat this step to create more fake records.
Note: In the project backend validation part is not done due to time shortage as I'm serving notice period and I have to give my 100% to my current company too.

In case of any issue in project setup please feel free to contact me on my email anisha.anni93@gmail.com.
